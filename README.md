# Data-Structures-Assignment-3
 
This is my Assignment 3 for Data Structures. This has 2 cpp files and 2 header files, this is for my iteration of a Queue and my functions that mess with vectors. The Queue is a template class, so it works with any data type. The main.cpp for this assignment runs both parts of this assignment and provides the output into the console. I've provided screenshots of the console output in this repository as well.
